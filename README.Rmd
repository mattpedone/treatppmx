An R package for personalized treatment selection at a single decision point.

Bayesian predictive model for personalized treatment selection for new
untreated patients, which leverages known predictive and prognostic biomarkers.
In particular, predictive biomarkers are exploited to inform a product partition model with covariates (PPMx) to obtain homogeneous clusters.

The implementation has been done in C++ through the use of Rcpp and RcppArmadillo.

Authors: Matteo Pedone, Raffaele Argiento, Francesco Stingo

Maintainer: Matteo Pedone.
