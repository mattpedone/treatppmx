\title{genmech clustering 2}
\usage{
genmech_clu2(nset = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{nset}{number of replicated scenarios generated}
}
\value{
a list of 8 elements.
\itemize{
\item \code{Y}: \eqn{n\times K \times}\code{nset} array. It contains \code{nset} matrices that store the outcome in the form of a multinomial experiment
\item \code{Yord}: \eqn{n\times}\code{nset} matrix. It contains the ordinal outcome for each replicated dataset
\item \code{treatment}: \eqn{n-}dimensional vector. It contains the treatment assigned
\item \code{pred}: \eqn{n\times}\eqn{(}\code{npred}\eqn{+}\code{nnoise}\eqn{)} matrix. It contains the predictive biomarkers (only the first \code{npred} are effectively used to generate the response)
\item \code{pred}: \eqn{n\times 2} matrix. It contains the prognostic biomarkers
\item \code{clu1}: contains the cluster label for patients assigned to Treatment 1
\item \code{clu2}: contains the cluster label for patients assigned to Treatment 2
\item \code{prob}: List of \eqn{T}. Each element is a \eqn{n\times K} matrix containing the response probabilities

\description{
Generates the data for the simulations scenarios S2 reported in the Supplementary Material.
It follows the strategy designed by Ma et al. (2019).
In particular, the outcome is a categorical variable representing \eqn{K=3} benefit-increasing levels.
\eqn{n} patients are assigned to \eqn{T=2} competing treatments.
Moreover, the clustering is known and fixed. We generate predictive biomarkers as Scenarion 4 in Page and Quintana (2018)
